This is the git project for homework assignments in [CIS 501: Fall 2016](http://cis.upenn.edu/~cis501/).

This code is written in Java and setup as an ant project. To get started:

1. clone the repo

1. from the root directory of the repo, run `ant test`. This will build the code
and run one simple test case. The test case will fail but the build itself
should succeed.
